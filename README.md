# MAT128B_Project2
Part2: averageDigit.m, displayDigit.m, readDigit.m

Part3: activate.m

Part4-6: training.m & routine.m for training;
         testing.m & run_test.m for testing.

part 7:

** note **
	it takes too long to use this activation function to train the network.
	So we only run 50 iterations of each train to see how well it goes.
	The result is acceptable. With 50 tains, we got about 70% accuracy.
